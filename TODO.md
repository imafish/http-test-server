- ~~support for returning a file~~
- ~~support HTTPs~~
- ~~support multiple servers~~
- ! support for assigning variables and use them in responses.
- read YAML using strict strategy
- update README
- add tests
- support for path param matching, e.g. /book/{id}/section{section_id}
- (Optional) refactor: preprocess config should convert YAML object of int type to float64; map[interface{}]interface{} type to map[string]interface{}, so in rule_matching, simplier logic is required.
